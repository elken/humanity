We have been very busy this week and have had lots of lovely visitors coming to see us including nick bye and roger Walters it was a pleasure to have you in at humanity to see all our lovely guys and ladies . Big thank you to Tracy and Jason woodcock for there fantastic donations we are so grateful and so are all our homeless and vulnerable we help . We have been open since June 17th and with The help of a signing in book we've had nearly 1300 people come in and visit us for help which is fantastic . It shows the need for humanity is truly out there . We are always needing food and clothing so any help we are grateful for . Friday from 3- 4.30 is our first mental health group and we are really looking forward to helping people . We are also open on Saturday from 10-2 . We now have 15 trustees which is marvellous and have appointed Anne Kirby and floridino ardesi as our general managers we are thrilled . All our staff are volunteers we are so proud of them so with love ❤️ and hugs to all xxx
