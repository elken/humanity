We have absolutely no funding from any where apart from the fact we pitched got a £10,000 grant which is paying for our kitchen and shower . Absolutely everything we do we rely on donations from the public and fundraising ourselves . We also have the best and committed bunch of volunteers who are making such a difference to people's life . How can we a bunch of volunteers feed , cloth. House do benefits for people . Make doctors appointments dentists and then go with some other guys for moral support . We are advocates for magistrates court and crown court . We hug we hold hands we are always there we do this because it's called love ❤️. Humanity has a beautiful atmosphere because we want them there with us . Why do we do it because we want them to achieve and to have wonderful lives . Because everyone deserves hope in life and at humanity we are giving it in spades xx
