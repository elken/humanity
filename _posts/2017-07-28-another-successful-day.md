Thank you for all the clothing donations we received today so much appreciated. 

Today we had 43 in for help and support with 4 being housed.We have also been offered 10 jobs in paignton for our guys with a local firm, many thanks. At humanity we are non religious, we support every creed and this is why we are Humanity Torbay, every person counts no matter what. We would like to thank everyone who is helping us and we greatly appreciate all of your help. Housing is the way forward and jobs. Nobody should be on the streets and at humanity we are helping to stop that thank you to the 13 volunteers we had today

With love ❤️ and hugs x
