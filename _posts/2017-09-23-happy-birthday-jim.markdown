Yesterday was Jim's birthday. The reason we put this photo on was that Jim not had a birthday card in 20 years everybody signed that card at humanity yesterday . He also had a cake with the singing candle . We all sat and cried that such small things could mean such a huge thing to another person . Everyone in society should be kind to another everyone should help and love another how wonderful would life be if we could do this and what a difference to people's life's it would make xxx![21687991_1703233099687013_5854747558757526562_n.jpg](/uploads/21687991_1703233099687013_5854747558757526562_n.jpg)
