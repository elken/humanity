What a busy day we had yesterday 67 people in humanity. We had some fantastic donations yesterday from oxfam in Torquay, and Lidl, we were overwhelmed. And a big thank you also to Melville hill for a huge amount of bacon . 
All food is gratefully received and means a huge amount to our ladies and gentlemen that they get something decent to eat. 
We had fantastic sandman Geoffrey cooking yesterday and it is always a pleasure to see him he really is a Torbay treasure along with our other Geoff who was cooking too .

We are now looking for volunteers who can help on a Sunday with opening 10-3 the weather will soon turn and we need this help for our homeless especially . We are so busy on a Saturday and this is much needed in the bay . 

We are very proud that 2 of our guys are starting university in the autumn. One is doing law the other humanities . I have been asked by the university to come up on their first day and meet with the chancellor I am hoping this time next year we will have many more. 
We now have 23 jobs been offered to us across the bay for our guys and this is the way forward to . 
We had susie colley come and visit us yesterday and she is the head of the chamber of commerce it was a pleasure . Also we had our mp Kevin foster come to visit with his wife hazel it was a warm and productive meeting thank-you both for coming . 
Then we had momentum a wonderful group of progressive people who support labour . Bruce , John , Lesley Ann and Virginia and I look forward to working with you all in the coming months . 

At humanity we never give up on anyone everyone deserves a chance in life and then some . So please any food you can donate we would be so grateful for as off yesterday without our figures for Saturday we have seen nearly 200 people imagine how many during the winter . So remember we are open Saturday at 10. So please if you see anyone homeless or vunerable send them to us so with love ❤️ and hugs have a beautiful day xxxx
