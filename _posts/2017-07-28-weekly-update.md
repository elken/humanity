This week has been a busy one. We’ve had over 100 people come to see us with many different problems.

Most of these homeless/vulnerable people have been fed, watered and given excellent advice by our dedicated team of volunteers, and helpers, and numerous have been housed. We do this because we care and are thrilled to be helping so many people in our local community. None of us are paid and we are determined to make a difference. Every person counts.

We have also had a huge amount of clothes donated that will go to those who need them the most and they will help many people. Please keep them coming. We always need food to feed the increased amount of people though our doors. Financial donations are very much appreciated, all the bills we pay are entirely funded by these, and this is the best way you can help fund us directly.

This week also saw up getting our website up and running. This will be updated daily, during the week, so keep an eye on it – www.humanitytorbay.org.uk

You can also find us on Twitter and Instagram as HumanityTorbay.

Please share these where ever you can. The more people who know about us the better.

Big Love
