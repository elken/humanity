Humanity Torbay had 62 people in for food and support today. We are so thrilled to be helping so many people. We now need help with food for lunches so if people would like to donate food or money we would be grateful. At humanity we have a signing in book so people can see who we help and what they have come in for.
Big thank you to all the volunteers who were fantastic today and our beloved sandman who cooked 40 breakfasts. So with love ❤️  and hugs tomorrow is another day xx
