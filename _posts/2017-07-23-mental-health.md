I have been asked to facilitate a support group to be held at humanity. The support group will focus on young men from the ages of 18- 25 and will be held in the evening. 

Time and date to be confirmed. It will concentrate on young men with mental health issues including depression and bipolar this age group is the biggest worry at the moment and this support group will be aimed at them with a view to starting a ladies group shortly after. A number of professionals know my interest in this subject because of my own sons problems with chronic mental health. It is a massive honour for humanity to be asked to take such a major role in this. Many homeless and vulnerable have varying degrees of mental health problems and the younger we get them the help the quicker it can make a difference. We will give you the time and date as soon as we can. We know this will be popular through.

Big Love
