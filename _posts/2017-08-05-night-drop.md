Humanity Torbay will be working as the main stay of a night drop in for homeless and vunerable people it will be the first of its kind for Torbay. 
I am working with a dedicated team of people to have this up and running as soon as possible. As people are aware we have been kindly given a number of buildings so it will be in Torquay. We are so excited to be able to have this as it will make a huge difference to people's lives and we will be able to pick up the most vulnerable in society who need our help so please share we will be looking for dedicated people to help with this so with love and purposes have a good evening xxxxxxxx
