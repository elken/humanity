Good morning. We know lots of people have been in touch with wonderful food donations and clothing we cannot thank you enough it's so needed . We are so proud that in Torbay we stand alone and are even more proud that we did not enter into a agreement to share our confidential information of the people coming to See us at humanity . Beneath this post there is a article by the guardian on what happens to homeless data and it makes horrifying reading . Our guys and ladies always come first with us . Our new mental health group will be up running from September 1st at 3 o'clock and will be open to everyone. Our alternative one will be on September 8 th same time but for 18-25 year old men the first of its kind in Torbay . Big thank -you to all the people who contacted me about volunteering for the night stop we will be running and the soup kitchen . I am said to say again firsts in Torbay and all of this being provided worn no funding and by a group of dedicated volunteers . It is amazing what the human spirit can achieve when they have to and I am so proud of our volunteers. When myself and Carolyn bacon set this up we had no idea it would have grown so quickly . We will have been going 4 months on August the 28th . And we have been at castle circus less than 2 months . Autumn and winter are fast approaching and we are already seeing over 200 people a week lots walking over from Paignton. If we can do this with no money can you imagine what we could do for the homeless and the vunerable if we did . We even have unpaid outreach workers who actually go out and send people to us . Everyone in life no matter who they are deserves a chance in life and at humanity that's what we do we empower with hope and love ❤️ xxxxxxxx
