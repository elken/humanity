Today we had a visit from our local MP Kevin Foster and his wife Hazel. They were both very interested on how we are doing and the struggles we have. They both listened, and really took an interest on Humanity Torbay. Mr Foster also pointed out areas on how he can help. It is refreshing to have such excellent support.
