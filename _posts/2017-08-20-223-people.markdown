Humanity has had 223 people in this week . Our signing in book has confirmed . We are so pleased to be making such a difference to people's life in Torbay . We are humbled so many are coming over from Paignton for support and help it's lovely to see people who Carolyn and I have known for such a long time . On Saturday we had 30 people come in for help . We will be putting out more posters and we know other groups follow our page and we would hope they will tell the guys there is now a service the first one in Torquay open on a Saturday . We are now working on getting the Sunday up and running as soon as possible . Big thank - you to Mandy and mike for there fantastic garden party yesterday for humanity over Â£300 raised . We are so proud of all our guys some of them have been on a very long journey of homelessness and we have to going to university in end of September beginning of October we could not be more proud of them if we tried . I am now looking for volunteers for our new nightly soup kitchen I am hoping lots of you will want to help . More details to follow shortly . So with hugs which at humanity is a must may you all have a beautiful day x
